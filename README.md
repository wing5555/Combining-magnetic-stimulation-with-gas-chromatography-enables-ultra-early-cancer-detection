# Combining-magnetic-stimulation-with-gas-chromatography-enables-ultra-early-cancer-detection
We develop methods and equipment for transcranial and peripheral therapeutic magnetic stimulation. In addition, we develop methods and equipment for the high-intensity non-invasive repetitive magnetic stimulation that can be simultaneously used for significant activation of the release of endogenous VOC markers of ultra-early urogenital cancers.

Female cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, vaginal cancer, kidney cancer and bladder cancer can be particularly successfully detected at ultra-early stages non-invasively and without the particularly burdensome emotional burden typical of conventional cancer detection methods using our system.
Generally speaking, our system can successfully detect not only female urological and genital cancers at their earliest stages. Prostate cancer, one of the most common and dangerous male cancers, can also be easily and non-invasively diagnosed using the proposed system.
