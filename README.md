# Combining-magnetic-stimulation-with-gas-chromatography-enables-ultra-early-cancer-detection
We develop methods and equipment for transcranial and peripheral therapeutic magnetic stimulation. In addition, we develop methods and equipment for the high-intensity non-invasive repetitive magnetic stimulation that can be simultaneously used for significant activation of the release of endogenous VOC markers of ultra-early urogenital cancers.

High-intensity magnetic stimulation allows us to treat all types of female urinary incontinence extremely effectively. High-intensity magnetic stimulation allows us to effectively treat all types of female urinary incontinence. Magnetic stimulation of the pelvic organs simultaneously allows us to significantly and temporarily increase the secretion of sweat from sweat glands, sebum from sebaceous glands, vaginal secretions, urine, and other biofluids containing specific volatile organic markers that characterize the very early stages of certain oncological and infectious diseases. While a female patient undergoes magnetic stimulation for highly effective treatment of urinary incontinence, we simultaneously non-invasively collect volatile organic compounds using a specially designed system for suctioning air and volatile impurities from the area affected by magnetic stimulation. The aspirated air sample is directed to the sorbent or directly to the inlet of an ultra-fast gas chromatograph. This allows us to very quickly, directly during the magnetic stimulation procedure, obtain information about the current oncological and infectious pathologies of a given patient, using specific profiles of volatile organic compounds characteristic of the aforementioned pathologies with very high specificity and accuracy. Generally speaking, not only the secretions of biofluids from the pelvic area containing a specific "odor of disease" (specific VOC profile), but also, for example, the discharge from the mammary glands and from the sweat and sebaceous glands located on the surface of the nipples and mammary glands, can be collected and analyzed by our system during alternative magnetic stimulation of the female breast area. This could in addition allow us to implement ultra-early detection of breast cancer in the future with our proposed system.
Female cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, vaginal cancer, kidney cancer and bladder cancer can be particularly successfully detected at ultra-early stages non-invasively and without the particularly burdensome emotional burden typical of conventional cancer detection methods using our system.
Generally speaking, our system can successfully detect not only female urological and genital cancers at their earliest stages. Prostate cancer, one of the most common and dangerous male cancers, can also be easily and non-invasively diagnosed using the proposed system.
