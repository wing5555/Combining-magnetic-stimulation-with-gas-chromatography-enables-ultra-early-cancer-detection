We develop methods and equipment for transcranial and peripheral therapeutic magnetic stimulation. In addition, we develop methods and equipment for the high-intensity non-invasive repetitive magnetic stimulation that can be simultaneously used for significant activation of the release of endogenous VOC markers of ultra-early urogenital cancers.
